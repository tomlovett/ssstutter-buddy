          SSStutterBuddy is entirely free-to-use for both researchers and PWS.
          We're not here to make money, <b>we're here to make a difference</b>.
          If you or your child have a stutter, you can support hard-working
          researchers as they advance our knowledge of stuttering's causes,
          expression, and treatment by particiating in studies. As a nice bonus,
          most studies compensate participants for their time and effort. So you
          can <b>do a good deed and get paid for it as well!</b>
        </p>
        <p className="lead self-center lg:self-start">
          You might be surprised, but the biggest impediment to stuttering
          research is usually not funding, research ideas, even technology â€”
          it's finding enough PWS to participate in the study!
