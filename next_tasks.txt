/tour progression
	We have two roles: P & R
	-p creates profile
	R posts a new study near P
	invites sent out to P; R can see the anonymous invitation
	P decides whether or not they're interested
	if no, data is kept private, nothing more happens
	if yes, an email is sent to P & R to connect. P&R coordinate a time to complete the study offline
	when done, the R marks the P complete, giving the P another badge (which helps R feel more confidence should they want to do a fully-digital study)

		Sanctity of this data is very important to us. And, on a personal level, we have great contempt who will fake having a speech impediment in order to swindle money from researchers.
			If you are guilty and have been caught, we ask you to not sign up for SB again, and to re-consider your life choices.
		If you think this was done in error, please send an email to support@ssstutterbuddy.com and we will follow up with you.
