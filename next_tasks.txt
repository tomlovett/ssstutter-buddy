/tour progression
	We have two roles: P & R
	-p creates profile
	R posts a new study near P
	invites sent out to P; R can see the anonymous invitation
	P decides whether or not they're interested
	if no, data is kept private, nothing more happens
	if yes, an email is sent to P & R to connect. P&R coordinate a time to complete the study offline
	when done, the R marks the P complete, giving the P another badge (which helps R feel more confidence should they want to do a fully-digital study)
