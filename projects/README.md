# Projects Directory

This directory contains project prompts and specifications generated by other LLMs to guide Cursor in executing specific projects within the codebase.

## Purpose

When working on tasks, Cursor should:
1. **Check this directory first** for any relevant project prompts or specifications
2. **Use project prompts as authoritative guidance** for the specific project being worked on
3. **Follow project-specific instructions** while still adhering to the general conventions in `.cursor/rules`
4. **Reference project prompts** when making implementation decisions

## Organization

- Each project should be organized in its own subdirectory
- Project files should contain:
  - Clear project objectives and requirements
  - Technical specifications and constraints
  - Implementation guidance and patterns
  - Any context needed to understand the project scope
- **Completed projects** are moved to `/projects/completed_projects/` after implementation
  - These serve as reference material for similar future work
  - See `/projects/completed_projects/README.md` for more information

## Relationship to .cursor/rules

Project prompts in this directory are **project-specific** and may supplement or provide additional context beyond the general rules in `.cursor/rules`. When project prompts conflict with general rules, project prompts take precedence for that specific project, but general rules should still be followed unless explicitly overridden.
