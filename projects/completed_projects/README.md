# Completed Projects

This directory contains completed project prompts and specifications. Projects are moved here after they have been fully implemented.

## Project Structure

Each completed project subdirectory contains:
- **`README.md`**: A summary document that serves as a passdown for the entire project
  - Provides an overview of what was implemented
  - Documents key decisions, patterns, and approaches used
  - Serves as the primary reference point for understanding the completed work
  - **Start here** when referencing a completed project - the README gives you the full context

## When to Check This Directory

**Immediately check this directory when:**
1. **Starting a similar feature** - Look for completed projects that implemented comparable functionality
2. **Encountering unfamiliar code patterns** - Find the project that introduced them to understand the reasoning
3. **Making architectural decisions** - Review how similar problems were solved previously
4. **Needing implementation examples** - See how project specifications were translated into code

## How to Use Completed Projects

1. **Find the relevant project subdirectory** - Look for projects with similar names or functionality
2. **Read the project's `README.md` first** - This gives you the complete overview and context
3. **Review the implementation details** - Examine the code, tests, and other documentation in that subdirectory
4. **Extract patterns and approaches** - Understand the decisions made and why they were chosen
5. **Apply learnings to current work** - Use insights while adapting to current requirements

## Critical Warnings

- **These projects are completed** - Do not modify or work on code in these directories
- **Patterns may be outdated** - Always cross-reference with current `.cursor/rules` and active project specifications
- **Use as reference, not gospel** - Completed projects show what worked before, but current requirements may differ
- **Prioritize active project specs** - When conflicts arise, current project specifications in `/projects` take precedence

## Value for LLM Assistants

Completed projects provide:
- **Quick context** - The `README.md` in each project gives you immediate understanding of what was built
- **Decision rationale** - Understand why certain approaches were chosen over alternatives
- **Consistency patterns** - See how similar features were implemented to maintain codebase consistency
- **Learning examples** - Study successful implementations to inform new work
- **Historical context** - Understand the evolution of the codebase and avoid repeating past mistakes

## Search Strategy

When looking for relevant completed projects:
- Check project subdirectory names for keywords matching your current task
- Read multiple project READMEs if working on a complex feature that may span several areas
- Look for projects that mention similar technologies, patterns, or user flows
- Don't limit yourself to exact matches - related projects often have transferable insights
