# SSStutter Buddy Project Rules

## Project Overview
- Rails 8.0.0.rc1 backend with Ruby 3.3.3
- React 19 frontend with Inertia.js
- PostgreSQL database
- ShadCN UI (built on Tailwind CSS) for styling
- Comprehensive testing with RSpec and Jest
- Authentication with JWT and OmniAuth
- Documentationand reference files in /.documentation directory
- Developer can print out full branch diffs into ./branch-diff.txt to help Cursor agent write merge commit messages for PR's

## Ruby/Rails Conventions

### Code Style
- Follow RuboCop configuration in .rubocop.yml
- Use frozen_string_literal: true at the top of all Ruby files
- Use snake_case for methods and variables
- Use PascalCase for classes and modules
- Prefer single quotes for strings unless interpolation is needed
- Use 2-space indentation
- Include Authentication and Gatekeeping concerns in controllers where needed
- Prefer object shorthand syntax: `{ var_name: }` instead of `{ var_name: var_name }`
- When method calls have multiple parameters with nested blocks, align the opening parenthesis with the method name to avoid deep indentation

### Rails Patterns
- Use concerns for shared functionality (see app/controllers/concerns/)
- Use Current.user pattern for current user access
- Use Inertia.js for server-side rendering with React
- Use Action Policy for authorization
- Use Factory Bot for test data
- Use Geocoder for location services
- Use Kaminari for pagination
- `inertia_share` always passes `Current.user` as `user` to the frontend
   - The `user` object includes its `participant` or `researcher` association when present (may be nil for anonymous users)

### Database
- Use PostgreSQL as the database
- Follow Rails naming conventions for tables and columns
- Use migrations for all database changes
- Use seeds.rb for initial data
- NEVER run migrations created by Cursor agent without explicit developer confirmation
- If a generated migration needs changes: rollback the migration first, then edit it - do NOT create a new migration to override the first one

## React/JavaScript Conventions

### Code Style
- Use ESLint configuration from eslint.config.js
- Use ES6 and avoid TypeScript whenever possible
- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Use functional components with hooks
- Use JSX file extension for React components
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for components
- Prefer object shorthand syntax: `{ varName }` instead of `{ varName: varName }`
- Use ES6 import/export syntax
- Use named exports for components and utilities
- Use default exports for pages and main components
- Prefer absolute imports using aliases to simplify filepaths
- Use relative imports only for closely related files in the same directory

### React Patterns
- Use Inertia.js for server-side rendering
- Use React Hook Form for form handling
- Use Zod for schema validation
- Use ShadCN UI components (built on Radix UI) for accessibility
- Use Tailwind CSS (via ShadCN) for styling
- Use Lucide React for icons
- Use Sonner for toast notifications

### File Organization
- Components in app/frontend/components/
- Pages in app/frontend/pages/
- Hooks in app/frontend/hooks/
- Schemas in app/frontend/schemas/
- Styles in app/frontend/styles/
- Tests in app/frontend/__tests__/

## Testing Conventions

### General Testing
- Use dynamically-generated dummy data rather than hard-coded values

### Ruby/Rails Testing
- Use RSpec for Ruby testing
- Use Factory Bot for test data
- Use Faker gem to generate dynamic dummy data
- Use request specs for API testing
- Use model specs for model testing
- Use controller specs for controller testing
- Use policy specs for authorization testing
- Use contexts with cascading let statements to organize test data and scenarios
- Use `before` blocks for setup operations, not within `it` blocks or expectations
- Structure tests with descriptive contexts that build upon each other

### JavaScript/React Testing
- Use Jest for JavaScript testing
- Use React Testing Library for component testing
- Use MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking
- Use @testing-library/user-event for user interactions
- Use @testing-library/jest-dom for custom matchers

### Test Organization
- Test files should mirror the source file structure
- Use descriptive test names
- Group related tests with describe blocks
- Use beforeEach for setup
- Use factories for test data

## Security Guidelines

### Authentication & Authorization
- Use session-based authentication for web users (cookies and sessions)
- Use Action Policy for authorization
- Use bcrypt for password hashing
- Validate all user inputs
- Use strong parameters in controllers
- Sanitize user data before database storage

### Data Protection
- Use bcrypt for password hashing
- Use HTTPS in production
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Use CORS configuration appropriately
- Follow Rails security best practices

## Performance Guidelines

### Ruby/Rails
- Use includes/joins to avoid N+1 queries
- Use counter caches where appropriate
- Use background jobs for heavy operations
- Use caching strategies (Redis when needed)
- Use database indexes for frequently queried columns

### React/JavaScript
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Use useMemo and useCallback for expensive calculations
- Lazy load components when appropriate
- Optimize bundle size with code splitting
- Use Vite for fast development builds

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality
- Run RuboCop before committing Ruby code
- Run ESLint before committing JavaScript code
- Run Prettier for consistent formatting
- Run `yarn test` for frontend tests, `yarn test:watch` for development
- Write tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed

### Git Workflow
- NEVER push commits to origin
- NEVER run heroku commands
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Use feature branches for new development
- Test thoroughly before merging

### Rails Console Usage
- NEVER use `rails console` or `rails c` in terminal commands
- Cursor agents cannot reliably execute multi-step commands in interactive Rails console sessions
- Instead, use `rails runner` to execute Ruby code: `rails runner "User.count"`
- For data manipulation: `rails runner "User.create!(name: 'Test')"`
- For debugging: use `rails runner` with puts/logger statements instead of console inspection
- Example: `rails runner "puts User.first.inspect"` instead of opening Rails console

## Project-Specific Patterns

### User Types and Access Control
- The application serves two distinct user types: Participants and Researchers
- Each user account has only a Participant or a Researcher association, never both
- A person may have separate accounts for different roles (e.g., one account as Researcher, another as Participant)
- Researchers cannot participate in their own studies
- Different areas and functionality are shown based on the user's association
- Use Current.user pattern for current user access
- Use sessions for user state management
- Use admin? helper from ApplicationPolicy for admin access
- The Participant side of the application allows unauthenticated access to viewing pages (digital studies, study show, researcher show), but anonymous users cannot access personal pages like the participant home page or profile

### Provisional users
- Anonymous/unauthenticated visitors can view and connect to studies by creating provisional users
- Provisional users are User records with a blank/null password and password_digest (identified by the provisional? method)
- Provisional users will not have a session
- Provisional users are only created when an anonymous/unauthenticated user connects with a study
- When an anonymous user connects to a study, they provide first name, last name, and email; the backend creates:
  - A provisional User record (with first_name, last_name, email, but no password or password_digest)
  - A Participant record associated with that User (may be incomplete)
  - A Connection record linking the Participant to the Study
- If an anonymous user tries to connect but their email matches an existing regular user account, prompt them to login
- When an existing provisional user tries to connect with a study, create a new Connection
- Provisional users cannot authenticate (cannot log in) until they set a password
- A provisional user can connect through multiple studies (through their Participant) without being required to convert to a regular user
- Provisional users can convert to regular users by setting a password (via "forgot password" flow or account claim functionality)
  - Use the "forgot password" email with slight text modifications if User.provisional?

### Route Organization
- User-related routes are namespaced under '/u/'
- Participant functionality routes are namespaced under '/p/'
- Researcher functionality routes are namespaced under '/r/'
- Frontend pages and directories follow the same namespace structure

### Route Access Control
- Public routes (/, /faq, /researchers, /participants) are accessible without authentication
- Participant routes ('/p/*') have mixed access:
  - **Publicly accessible (no authentication required)**: `/p/digital-studies`, `/p/studies/:id`, `/p/researchers/:id`
  - **Requires authentication and participant association**: `/p/` (home), `/p/participants/:id` (profile pages), `/p/connections`, `/p/invitations` (create action)
- Researcher routes ('/r/*') require authentication and researcher association
- User management routes ('/u/*') require authentication (except signup/login flows)
- Redirect authenticated Researchers to `/r` (their home page) if they try to access any participant route
- Redirect authenticated Participants without complete profiles to their profile edit page when accessing protected participant routes
- Anonymous users accessing participant routes will see a simplified header instead of the sidebar navigation
- Use Gatekeeping concern methods (redirect_if_not_researcher, gatekeep_all_researchers, require_registered_participant) for role-based redirects
- Gatekeeping methods should allow nil Current.user for publicly accessible participant routes (skip redirects when user is nil)

### Study Management
- Use Study model for research studies
- Use Connection model for study-participant relationships
- Use Invitation model for study invitations
- Support in-person, digital and hybrid (both) studies
- Use email alerts to notify Participants when new in-person or hybrid studies are published in their area
- Use email notifications when Connections are made between Researchers and Participants
- Connections are created when Participants express interest in Studies
- Studies can include autosend settings (autosend_url, autosend_message, autosend_verified_only) that automatically send a survey link and optional message to Participants when they connect to a study. The autosend_url and autosend_message are included in the connection email. If autosend_verified_only is enabled (default: true), the URL is only sent to verified (non-provisional) users, not to anonymous/provisional users browsing the site

### Location Services
- Use Geocoder for address geocoding
- Use Location model for address management
- Support international locations with countries gem
- Use verified addresses for reliability

### File Organization
- Keep frontend and backend code organized
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Group related functionality together
- Use appropriate directory structure

## Error Handling

### Ruby/Rails
- Use rescue blocks appropriately
- Log errors with appropriate context
- Log errors to Sentry
- Return meaningful error messages
- Use Rails error pages for production

### React/JavaScript
- Use try/catch for async operations
- Handle loading and error states
- Show user-friendly error messages
- Use error boundaries for React errors

## Documentation

### Code Documentation
- Use YARD for Ruby documentation
- Use JSDoc for JavaScript documentation
- Document complex business logic
- Keep README.md updated

### API Documentation
- Document API endpoints
- Include request/response examples
- Document authentication requirements
- Keep API documentation current

## Deployment

### Environment Configuration
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Use Rails credentials for secrets
- Configure database properly for each environment
- Use appropriate logging levels

### Production Considerations
- Use PostgreSQL in production
- Configure proper CORS settings
- Set up monitoring and logging
- Use background job processing
- Configure proper caching strategies
